# quest-install

An adb installer for Quest / Quest2 / android and more.

It expects you to have a directory with your data, and obb's in subdirectories like(for example):

my.project.supergame.com/my.project.supergame.com.apk
my.project.supergame.com/obb/textures.obb
my.project.supergame.com/obb/stuff.obb

Copy quest-install.sh to somewhere in path.
run 
quest-install.sh my.project.supergame.com

And ... it will be installed.
